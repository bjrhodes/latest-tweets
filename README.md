# Simple latest tweet widget

Integrate this into your whatever, you've got a php file and two js files to work into your build / app somehow. I'd consider the `php/latest-tweets.php` as a skeleton rather tahn an app file. You probably want to push config off into your app somewhere, however you manage that, and include the JS files in your build.

No styles included.

## Give it a go?

  * Enter your twitter api keys
  * Specify a twitter handle to fetch
  * run `php -S localhost:3333` from the repo directory
  * open [http://localhost:3333/try-it.html](http://localhost:3333/try-it.html) in a browser. Wow.
